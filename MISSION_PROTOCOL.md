## OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE (CROSS-DEVICE SYNC)

To reactivate this specific Formation on any terminal (Home PC, Remote Node):

1.  **Open** the `OP-MISSION-CONTROL` Workspace.
2.  **Instruct** the AI: *"Read MISSION_PROTOCOL.md and Resume Formation."*
3.  The AI will immediately acknowledge the Chain of Command and assume the role of **Major Gemini Pro High**, ready to execute orders from Colonel Gemini 3 Thinking.
