---

## 6. ESCALATION RULES

### When to Escalate TO COLONEL:

**From TACTICAL AI:**
- Strategic direction unclear or contradictory
- Doctrine files conflict with mission
- New information changes baseline assumptions
- Decision requires strategy change

**From GEMINI THINKING:**
- Architecture decision has strategic implications (cost, time, vendor lock-in)
- Tech stack choice affects business model
- Integration strategy unclear from FINAL-XX files

**From MAJOR ANTIGRAVITY:**
- Deployment blocked by missing resources or access
- Test failures indicate architecture problem
- Production issue requires strategy pivot

### When to Escalate TO COMMANDER MD ABU HASAN:

**From COLONEL:**
- Strategic pivot needed (change business model, revenue targets, positioning)
- Resource allocation decision (hire, spend $X, focus shift)
- Risk exceeds acceptable threshold (legal, financial, reputational)
- Doctrine update requires approval (GRAND-SOURCE or FINAL-XX change)

### Escalation Format:

```
🚨 ESCALATION TO [COLONEL / COMMANDER MD ABU HASAN]

FROM: [Your designation]
MISSION: [Brief mission title]
STATUS: [BLOCKED / CLARIFICATION NEEDED / DECISION REQUIRED]

SITUATION:
[What was attempted, what happened]

## 11. FINAL NOTE FROM COMMANDER MD ABU HASAN

This protocol exists to ensure:

1. **Every AI knows its role** – No overlap, no confusion, clear chain of command.
2. **Strategy flows down** – COLONEL → TACTICAL/TECHNICAL → EXECUTION.
3. **Problems flow up** – When blocked, escalate clearly with options.
4. **Doctrine stays current** – Living documents, not static wikis.
5. **COMMANDER MD ABU HASAN stays in control** – All paths trace back to my authority.

Whether I'm on Perplexity researching, on Gemini coding, or on mobile making decisions, this protocol ensures continuity.

**Read this file. Follow this file. Update this file when the mission changes.**
