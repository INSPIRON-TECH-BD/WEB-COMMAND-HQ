## 5. Project Requirements (Client Onboarding Form)
*Copy these questions into the "Requirements" tab of your Project Catalog setup.*

**1. Institutional Identity Node**
> Please provide your official Business Name, Registered Address, and BIN/TIN Number (if applicable) exactly as they should appear on invoices and reports.

**2. Legacy Data Source**
> What is your current accounting method? (e.g., Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, Manual Ledgers). *If migrating, please attach a sample of your current Trial Balance or Chart of Accounts.*

**3. Banking & Currency Architecture**
> List the banks you operate with (e.g., BRAC, Islami Bank) and the currencies you transact in (BDT, USD, EUR). *Do you need automated bank statement import rules set up?*

**4. Operational Scope**
> Briefly describe your business model (e.g., "Manufacturing footwear components," "Exporting leather goods," "Aquaculture farm"). *What is your biggest pain point right now? (e.g., "Inventory doesn't match," "Don't know my real profit").*

## 6. Institutional FAQ (Deflecting Objections)
*Add these to your Project Catalog "Frequently Asked Questions" to filter out low-budget clients.*

**Q: Why is your "Starter" node more expensive than other bookkeepers?**
> **A:** I do not do "data entry." I engineer **Institutional Architecture**. My setup includes a custom Chart of Accounts tailored for NBR compliance and automated bank rules. This saves you 20+ hours of manual work every month. You are paying for the *system*, not the hours.

**Q: Can you migrate my data from Tally/Excel?**
> **A:** Yes. This is covered in the **Professional Node**. I use custom Python scripts to clean and map your legacy data into Manager ERP, ensuring 100% integrity. I do not manually type old data; I migrate it programmatically.

**Q: Do you provide monthly support?**
> **A:** Yes. After the initial implementation, I offer a **"Sentry Active"** retainer for monthly auditing, VAT return preparation, and financial reporting. This is a separate engagement we can discuss after the setup is live.

**Q: What is the "Zero Error Protocol"?**
> **A:** It is my proprietary validation method. I use GitHub Actions to run automated checks on your ledger, ensuring that Inventory = COGS and Bank Balances = Real World. If there is a 0.01 BDT discrepancy, the system alerts me immediately.
