**🎨 VISUAL MEDIA STRATEGY (FOR AI GENERATION)**

MD ABU HASAN, since you are using AI to generate your media, here are the prompts/concepts you should use for your images or PDFs:

1. **For Starter:** A high-tech, clean "Financial Blueprint" showing a structured Chart of Accounts. Use a "Blueprint Blue" and "Electric Aqua" aesthetic.  
2. **For Professional:** A "Data Migration Bridge" visual, showing data flowing from old systems into a glowing Manager.io node. Use a "Dark Mode" technical aesthetic.  
3. **For Enterprise:** A "Command Center" or "Sentry Dashboard" showing financial metrics, GitHub logos, and manufacturing icons. This should look like a high-level "Mission Control" screen.

**MD ABU HASAN, THE TEXT IS READY FOR DEPLOYMENT.**

Next Action: 1\. Go to your Upwork Project Catalog.
